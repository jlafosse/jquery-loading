jquery.loading
=============
The loading plugin overlays a "waiting spinner" over an element that is typically being called through ajax or [hijack](https://github.com/jlafosse/jquery-hijack)

Installation
============
Include script *after* the jQuery library (unless you are packaging scripts in an alternative manner):

    <script src="/path/to/jquery.loading.js"></script>

Usage
=====
It doesn't get any easier than this :)

    $('#foo').loading();
